Valse romantique is a solo piano piece written by the French composer Claude Debussy (1862-1918) in 1890. It is in the key of F minor.

The piece is divided in several small parts.

However the piece's style is late romantic and not the impressionism for which he is known. It is one of his amateur works that he composed while studying at the Paris Conservatory.
